# The Annoying Alarm

Do you find yourself sleeping through your alarms too often and missing
important appointments, meetings, and/or life events? Is it just *too easy* to
hit that sweet, sweet snooze button? Do you enjoy mental stimulation first thing
in the morning?

If you answered 'yes' to any of these questions, I have the solution for you! I
present to you: **The Annoying Alarm**! While your old, boring alarm makes it
trivial to snooze your alarm by pushing a button, **The Annoying Alarm** makes
you solve a puzzle or play a minigame before turning the alarm off.

## Operation

Alarms are set and go off like any regular alarm, but the catch is that they
cannot be snoozed or turned off until you complete a minigame.

### Minigames
Sliding Puzzle.<br/>
Addition Puzzle.

### Continuation development
Implement more puzzles/games. <br/>
Implement the ability to select alarm ringtone. <br/>
Apply dynamic difficulty, increase the difficulty of the puzzle when user choose to snooze. <br/>
Ability to select prefered puzzle/games.
